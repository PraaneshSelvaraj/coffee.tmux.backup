Coffee is a modern and intuitive tmux plugin manager with powerful CLI and terminal UI (TUI). It empowers users to easily install, update, enable/disable, and remove tmux plugins with rich progress feedback and asynchronous operations.

## Features

- Plugin installation, removal, and upgrade with progress bars and async operations
- Declarative YAML plugin configuration files for easy setup and customization
- Lock file keeping track of installed plugins, versions, and environment variables
- Easy enable/disable of plugins without uninstalling
- Keyboard-driven keybindings modeled after tmux conventions for streamlined workflows

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- tmux >= 3.0
- Python 3.8+
- git

### Clone & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PraaneshSelvaraj/coffee.tmux ~/.local/share/coffee
cd ~/.local/share/coffee
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Add Coffee CLI to PATH

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/coffee/bin:$PATH"
```

Add this line to your shell config file (e.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) to make it permanent.

### tmux Configuration

Add the following to your `.tmux.conf` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/tmux.conf`):

```bash
source-file ~/.local/share/coffee/coffee.tmux
```

After editing your tmux config, reload it with:

```bash
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

### Install Plugins

After setup and reloading tmux, run:

```bash
coffee install
```

This installs all plugins configured in your YAML files.

## Usage

### CLI Commands

```bash
coffee install # Install configured plugins
coffee update # Check for plugin updates
coffee upgrade # Upgrade plugins with available updates
coffee upgrade tmux-sensible # Upgrade a specific plugin
coffee remove tmux-sensible # Remove a plugin
coffee list # List installed plugins
coffee info tmux-sensible # Show plugin details
coffee enable tmux-sensible # Enable a plugin
coffee disable tmux-sensible # Disable a plugin
```

### TUI Interface

Launch the TUI interface via by pressing the keybinding (e.g., `prefix + C`).

Navigate with keys:

- `H` - Home tab (view installed/enabled plugins)
- `I` - Install tab (view and install plugins from config)
- `U` - Update tab (check and apply updates)
- `R` - Remove tab (remove plugins)

Use `j`/`k` or arrow keys to move selections, `Space` to mark/toggle, and follow on-screen controls.

## Plugin Configuration

Create YAML files in:

```bash
~/.config/tmux/coffee/plugins/
```

Example configuration:

```yaml
name: "tmux-ip-address"
url: "anghootys/tmux-ip-address"
local: False
source: ["ip_address.tmux"]
env:
  FOO: "BAR"
```

Fields:

- `name`: Plugin name (required)
- `url`: GitHub repo path `<owner>/<repo>` (required)
- `tag`: Optional tag or branch to check out
- `local`: Set false for github repos
- `source`: List of plugin source script files loaded by tmux
- `env`: Environment variables to set when sourcing the plugin

## Uninstall Plugins

To uninstall a plugin, remove its YAML configuration file and run:

```bash
coffee remove <plugin-name>
```

Alternatively, use the Remove tab in the TUI to uninstall plugins interactively.
